# Titanic Analysis with Python & Plotly
Exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under revision. A cleaned and structured version of the notebook is coming soon.

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset using Python and Plotly to explore factors that influenced survival, such as gender, ticket class, fare paid, and cabin location.

Although the original report was a group project for a university statistics course, **all Python code, data processing, and visualizations were created independently by me**.

In this repository, you will find two Jupyter notebooks. The first contains the original version of the code; the second is a cleaner, more professional, and readable version. It is important to note that I learned Python on the go for my numerical methods and statistics classes at college, so back then I had no idea how to take a correct approach to Pythonic coding and best practices.

## üîß Tools & Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express & Plotly Graph Objects

## üìä Key Questions
- Did gender influence survival rates?
- Did passenger class or fare impact the chances of survival?
- How did social structure affect access to lifeboats?

## üìà Main Features
- Cleaned and transformed real-world Titanic data (`titanic3.xlsx`).
- Created interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Grouped passengers by age, class, and gender to discover survival patterns.
- Applied data discretization and categorization for deeper insights.

## üìÅ Files in this Repository
- `TitanicFinalCode.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code, visualizations, and analysis.
- `TitanicFinalCode_2025.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with a clean, standardized version of the code (Coming soon).
- `titanic3.xlsx`: Dataset used (sourced from Kaggle).
- `Informe_Pfinal.pdf`: Original academic report in Spanish.
- `Informe_Pfinal_English.pdf`: English-translated version of the final report, created for this portfolio (Coming soon).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
- Clone the repository (if you haven‚Äôt already):
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Aurionidas/titanic-analysis-python-plotly
  cd titanic-analysis-python-plotly

- Install Python dependencies:
  
  You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy plotly openpyxl

- (Optional) Create a virtual environment
  
  This is recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install pandas numpy plotly openpyxl

- Open the notebook
  
  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook

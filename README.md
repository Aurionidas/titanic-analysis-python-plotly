# Titanic Analysis with Python & Plotly
Exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.

> ⚠️ This project is currently under revision. A cleaned and structured version of the notebook is coming soon.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset using Python and Plotly to explore factors that influenced survival, such as gender, ticket class, fare paid, and cabin location.

Although the original report was a group project for a university statistics course, **all Python code, data processing, and visualizations were created independently by me**.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express & Plotly Graph Objects

## 📊 Key Questions
- Did gender influence survival rates?
- Did passenger class or fare impact the chances of survival?
- How did social structure affect access to lifeboats?

## 📈 Main Features
- Cleaned and transformed real-world Titanic data (`titanic3.xlsx`).
- Created interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Grouped passengers by age, class, and gender to discover survival patterns.
- Applied data discretization and categorization for deeper insights.

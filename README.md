# Titanic Analysis with Python & Plotly

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset using Python and Plotly to explore factors that influenced survival, such as gender, ticket class and hosting zones inside the ship.

Although the original report was a group project for a university statistics course, **all Python code, data processing, and visualizations were created independently by me**.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express & Plotly Graph Objects

## 📊 Key Questions
- Did gender influence survival rates?
- Did passenger class or fare impact the chances of survival?
- How did social structure affect access to lifeboats?

## 📈 Main Features
- Cleaned and transformed real-world Titanic data (`titanic3.xlsx`).
- Created interactive visualizations with Plotly.
- Grouped passengers by age, class, and gender to discover survival patterns.
- Applied data discretization and categorization for better insights.
